Description: This uses ImageMagick to create multi-page PDFs that are smaller
    in size than using PDF devices for certain types of plots, e.g. using
    graphics::image, or when there are many points on a plot.  These wrapper
    functions are similar to \code{im.convert} in the \code{animation} package.
